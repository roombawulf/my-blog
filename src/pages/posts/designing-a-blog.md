description: A brief look into the style and layout of my blog.
---

Ever since I designed my first website back in January, I have learnt a lot about what I like/dislike with regards to web-design. I always wanted my site to look pleasant. However, designing things is *hard* and I suck at it. This is the 3rd iteration of my website (along with the addition of this blog) and I "think" I am happy with it so far. So here I am briefly going over the design of my blog. Some of this leaks over to my [homepage](https://hraza.dev) too.

I **really** like earthy-neutral tones and have tried to stick to the [60-30-10 rule](https://uxplanet.org/the-60-30-10-rule-a-foolproof-way-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-d15625e56d25) as much as possible.

## The Main Stuff

This is a list of markdown I will probably use a ton. Although, I am certain that my markdown skills will widen as I get better at conveying my thoughts into writing.

### Code 

Inline code will `look like this` and code blocks are rendered via [expressive-code](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code):

```js
// this is some javascript code
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry()
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

scene.add(mesh)
```

```glsl
// this is some glsl code
void main {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

### Text Formatting

We have **bold** text and *italic* text. I mean not much else to say really...
