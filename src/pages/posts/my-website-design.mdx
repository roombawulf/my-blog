import DemoMDX from './DemoMDX.jsx'

Ever since I designed my first website back in January, I have learnt a lot about what I like/dislike with regards to web-design. However, designing things is *hard* and I suck at it. This iteration aims to keep the design as simple as possible. I'll use *threejs/WebGL* for the "shiny" parts of my website... once I get around to it. 

Here I am briefly going to go over the *current* design, choices of technologies and so forth...

## The Astro Framework

Beforehand, I have used [React](https://react.dev) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to build my website. However, I realise that I don't necessarily need all the tools these frameworks provide. This website is not a fully featured web application. At most, I would use React for 3D development through the useful [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) library.

This is where [Astro](https://astro.build) comes in. It is an *all-in-one* framework with speed in mind. I work with `.astro` file types which are essentially `.html` files with a little bit extra. Astro also allows me to optionally bundle frameworks likes React, Vue or Svelte into their own little components (I could even mix them together). So when I want to use those tools, I can contain them in their own little components whilst leaving the rest of the site to be pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript.

## Color Scheme

I **really** like earthy-neutral tones and have tried to stick to the [60-30-10 rule](https://uxplanet.org/the-60-30-10-rule-a-foolproof-way-to-choose-colors-for-your-ui-design-d15625e56d25) as much as possible. This article on [design systems](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/building-a-design-system-from-scratch/) from Maxime Heckel was extremely helpful in understanding some concepts. I'm not sure if its good practice, but I directly style HTML elements as of right now. You can see my defined CSS global variables in `:root` with your browser's dev tools.

## Markdown & MDX

Markdown is simple and easy so that is what I use for these posts. Additionally, I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which allows for a mix of *markdown* and *JSX* for extra flexability (Astro seems to work quite nicely with it too). 

### Code 

Of course I will be showing code here and there. Inline code is already `styled` but code blocks were a bit more tricky. I came across a fairly new library called [expressive-code](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code) which was exactly what I was looking for. Examples of code blocks are shown below.

```js
// this is some javascript code
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry()
const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)

scene.add(mesh)
```

```glsl
// this is some glsl code
void main {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

### Components in MDX

MDX allows for slotting in components which is extremely useful to add some dynamic presentation. The following threejs environment is a component that is slotted in directly into the `.mdx` file of this post. The code looks like this:

```mdx title="my-website-design.mdx"
MDX allows for slotting in components...
<DemoMDX />
```

Which loads this *threejs* environment (you can rotate this by the way):

<DemoMDX client:load />

...and if you are interested the code for this looks like so:

```jsx title="DemoMDX.jsx"
import { shaderMaterial, OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";
import { Canvas, extend, useFrame } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { useRef } from "react";

const BlobMaterial = shaderMaterial(
    { u_time: null },
    `
        uniform float u_time;
        varying float v_displace;
        
        float mod289(float x){return x - floor(x * (1.0 / 289.0)) * 289.0;}
        vec4 mod289(vec4 x){return x - floor(x * (1.0 / 289.0)) * 289.0;}
        vec4 perm(vec4 x){return mod289(((x * 34.0) + 1.0) * x);}

        float noise(vec3 p){
            vec3 a = floor(p);
            vec3 d = p - a;
            d = d * d * (3.0 - 2.0 * d);

            vec4 b = a.xxyy + vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
            vec4 k1 = perm(b.xyxy);
            vec4 k2 = perm(k1.xyxy + b.zzww);

            vec4 c = k2 + a.zzzz;
            vec4 k3 = perm(c);
            vec4 k4 = perm(c + 1.0);

            vec4 o1 = fract(k3 * (1.0 / 41.0));
            vec4 o2 = fract(k4 * (1.0 / 41.0));

            vec4 o3 = o2 * d.z + o1 * (1.0 - d.z);
            vec2 o4 = o3.yw * d.x + o3.xz * (1.0 - d.x);

            return o4.y * d.y + o4.x * (1.0 - d.y);
        }

        void main() {

            vec3 pos = position;

            v_displace = noise((1.6 * pos) + u_time) + noise((1.8* pos) - 1.33 * u_time);
            pos += normal * v_displace;

            vec4 modelPosition = modelMatrix * vec4(pos, 1.0);
            vec4 viewPosition = viewMatrix * modelPosition;
            vec4 projectedPosition = projectionMatrix * viewPosition;

            gl_Position = projectedPosition;
        }
    `,
    `
        uniform float u_time;
        varying float v_displace;

        void main() {
            vec3 col1 = vec3(1.0, 0.784 * (0.1 * sin(u_time)), 0.306);
            vec3 col2 = vec3(0.95, 0.396, 0.118);

            vec3 fcol = mix( col1, col2, v_displace );

            gl_FragColor = vec4(fcol, 1.0);
        }
    `
)
extend({ BlobMaterial })

function Blob() {

    const material = useRef()
    useFrame((state, delta) => {
        material.current.u_time = state.clock.elapsedTime
    })
    
    return(
        <mesh>
            <icosahedronGeometry args={[1, 12]} />
            <blobMaterial ref={material} />
        </mesh>
    )
}

function DemoMDX() {
    return(
        <div style={{ marginBottom: '2rem', height: '40svh'}}>
            <Canvas>
                <Blob />
                <OrbitControls />
            </Canvas>
        </div>
    )
}
export default DemoMDX
```

## Stuff for the Future

So far this is what I am working with. I intend to improve things over time once I realise what I actually need. 
At the moment, the only thing I have in mind is a *contents section for navigating through headers*. 

Thanks for reading!
